    "### What Is Knowledge Representation (KR)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* KR is the process of **structuring information so machines can reason, infer, and act** using it. Essentially, it **bridges raw data with intelligent behavior** ([UpGrad][1]).\n",
    "* **Core objectives** of KR include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Enabling **deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning**\n",
    "  * Capturing **semantic relationships and context**\n",
    "  * Providing **representational adequacy** — expressive power to model uncertainty, exceptions, defaults ([UpGrad][1])."

    "#### **Core Objectives of KR**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Facilitate Inference & Reasoning:** Supports *deductive* logic (e.g., expert systems like MYCIN), *inductive* generalizations, and *abductive* explanation-based inference ([1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capture Semantic Relationships & Context:** KR models entities, attributes, and relations—using *ontologies* (e.g. SNOMED, FOAF), *semantic networks* (is‑a, part‑of), and context-sensitive rules ([1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensure Representational Adequacy:** Must handle rich knowledge: uncertainty, defaults, exceptions, and non-monotonicity (belief revision when new facts arrive) ([1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maintain Consistency & Clarity:** Use description logics (OWL/RDFS) and validation tools to detect inconsistencies and maintain modularity at scale ([1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:** Google Knowledge Graph allows Google Search to answer questions by **reasoning about entities and their relationships**, rather than just matching keywords."

    "##### **1. Propositional & First-Order Logic**\n",
    "* Propositional logic associates truth values with statements; simple but limited ([3]).\n",
    "* First-order logic provides greater expressivity with quantifiers and variables, foundational to formal reasoning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Description Logics & Ontologies**\n",
    "* DLs are decidable fragments of FOL used in OWL and RDFS; enabling classification, consistency checking, and inference.\n",
    "* Ontologies provide **shared conceptualization**: explicit, rich definitions of domain entities and constraints ([1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Semantic Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graphs of nodes (concepts/entities) and labeled edges (relations like is‑a, part‑of). Useful in NLP and scene understanding ([4], [1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Frames and Scripts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Frames structure stereotypical situations or objects with “slots” for default values (e.g., a \"restaurant\" frame with slots like menu, location).\n",
    "* Scripts encode common sequences of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **5. Production Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple **IF–THEN logic systems**, common in expert systems or control logic (e.g., “If temperature > 100°C, then turn off heater”).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **6. Probabilistic & Model-based Reasoning**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bayesian networks, fuzzy logic, Dempster–Shafer frameworks allow reasoning under uncertainty.\n",
    "* **Model-based reasoning** uses causal or physical world models (e.g. diagnostic expert systems) ([1], [5]).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **7. Embeddings & Distributed Representations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encode entities and relations into vector spaces for tasks like link prediction and clustering (e.g. TransE, ComplEx).\n",
    "* Useful when combining structured and unstructured data, enabling modern applications like question answering ([6]).\n"
