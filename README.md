## **Proposed README.md**

### Knowledge Representation & Knowledge Graphs 

Welcome to the **Knowledge Representation & Knowledge Graphs** repository!  
This repository is based on a hands-on workshop led at the **Colab Innovation Hub ML Engineering community**.  
It covers the fundamentals of **Knowledge Representation (KR)**, **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)**, and practical graph-based AI workflows using Python tools such as **NetworkX**, **RDFLib**, and **LLM embeddings**.

### Overview

**Knowledge Representation (KR)** is the foundation of intelligent systems — it transforms raw data into a form that machines can **reason about, query, and act upon**.  
In this workshop series, you'll learn:

- **Theory KR**: inference, semantics, representational adequacy.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: building, traversing, and enriching them with metadata.
- **Graph algorithms**: shortest path, centrality, connectivity.
- **RDF triples & semantic metadata storage**.
- **Educational recommender systems** using **LLM embeddings** and graph traversal.
